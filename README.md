to compile sass `sass --watch styles:static`

# Notes
- I checked the browser compatibility with this site: https://www.browseemall.com/Compatibility/ValidateCSS
- I didn't put in any vendor prefixes, in a production environment I would write a gulp task for that
- I left the compiled .css in, so the repository can just be cloned and evaluated without having to do any additional compiling.
